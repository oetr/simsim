This is an example of how to use the simulator to obtain one execution trace and leakage traces of the RijndaelFast implementation available from http://point-at-infinity.org/avraes/rijndaelfast.asm.html.

Here is how a mean leakage trace of 1000 traces looks like:

The simulator runs 1000 simulations with a fixed key and random plaintext.
After obtaining the traces, I run a CPA in Octave.
Here are the absolute correlation coefficients for each key:
