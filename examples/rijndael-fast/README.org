This is an example of how to use the simulator to obtain an execution trace and leakage traces of the RijndaelFast implementation available from http://point-at-infinity.org/avraes/rijndaelfast.asm.html.

Simulation is done in Racket, data analysis in Octave.

The Octave file shows how to load the data.
